## Nissan Streetview Puzzle Game

Instructions on adapting the puzzle:

1. Edit any copy, linking etc in App.js file found in ./src
2. Changing and/or replacing images below:
   1. Place updated puzzle images(plain jpg without any puzzle edits etc) in the folder: ./src/img
   2. Import those images at the top of App.js such as 'import newPuzzle from "./static/img/puzzle-1.jpg";'
   3. Further down in the App.js file, replace the src for the image choices such as "<img className="imgChoice" id="option1" src={newPuzzle} alt="" />"
   4. Run the program locally by typing "npm start" and get the url for each image using the inspector such as "/static/media/puzzle-    3.542683fc.jpg" as this is the compiled URL for this image.
   5. Place the compiled URLs in the main.js file ,found at /public/js/main.js, at the top of the file next to "images" : ["url here]" in the same order as the choices in the choice menu for the puzzle.
3. Change code in public/js/iframe.js to suit where you wish to iframe this game


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
